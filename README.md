This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Mini project of a counter and summing up numbers.

There is a dropdown that contains numbers from 1-9. When user clicks on one of the numbers, the number will be added to a section that will have all of the selected numbers. There is another section for the sum, which will display the sum of all of the selected numbers.

User could not select the same number twice, but they could remove a selected number by deleting it from the selected numbers section.
